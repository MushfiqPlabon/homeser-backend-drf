# api/models.py
# This file is typically used to define database models for a Django app.
# In this project, models are primarily defined in their respective app directories
# (e.g., 'accounts', 'services', 'orders', 'payments').
# This file serves as a placeholder and can be used if the 'api' app
# were to define its own database models in the future.


# Create your models here.
