# utils/signals.py
# Django signals for the utils package

# This file is intentionally left empty for now.
# It can be used to define signals that should be triggered
# when certain events occur in the application.

# Example of how to define a signal:
# from django.dispatch import Signal
#
# my_signal = Signal()

# Example of how to connect a signal to a handler:
# from django.dispatch import receiver
#
# @receiver(my_signal)
# def my_signal_handler(sender, **kwargs):
#     # Handle the signal
#     pass
